<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

If you're a Source Engine server owner you might have heard of SourceBans at least once. SourceBans works on web and server sides, helping the server's administration with tasks and the owners with configuring and having acces to the server without being connected. SourceBans is a great source for logs and data, retrieved dinamically from the server's Database.
SourceBans Laravel Remake is actually the remake of the already existing SourceBans, made with PHP and other frameworks and libraries.

Here's why you should consider updating to Laravel:
* In this version of SourceBans, you will have the same functions from the original SourceBans, but updated to the latest versions of the frameworks.
* Top security (as much as possible for PHP) by using Laravel Jetstream's authentification system and also the Steam Login system.
* Fast Databse queries which retrieve the data in real time using Livewire.
* Installation, configuration and use is more user-friendly and dev-friendly, as you can change everything just as you like.
* These past years the "Dark Mode" or "Dark Theme" has gained a lot of popularity and for that we decided to use the Tailwind CSS framework, along with different scripts, to give the possibility of having the "Dark Mode" on the web panel either by using the switch, either by using the systems (Window's) default theme.

Of course, these are just some of the updates we've done to the original project.
